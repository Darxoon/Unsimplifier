# Unsimplifier

A Data Editor for the Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door Remake

--> <https://darxoon.neocities.org/Unsimplifier/> <--

## Usage

To use this tool, you need a US ROM of the TTYD Remake or a US copy of it on a homebrewed Switch.

Open the link above and follow the instructions to get started.

If you want to open one of the game's files to modify them, either head to the menu bar on the top and select `File > Open` or click on one of the files in Unsimplifier's romfs explorer.

Once the file has been loaded, you can expand the objects and change their properties, which will have different effects based on what file you are editing. This program supports many file types, which have been documented [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pZogGh00xy939FdCG62uWjxZnkP1G4gjDGBG4TntbKY/)

To load the updated file into the game, go to File > Save, which will download the file into your Browser's Download Folder. Then place it in the correct place of Atmosphere's or your Emulator's Mod folder.

## Features

* Place new NPCs, Items, Decoration and much more.
* Edit much of the game's already existing content
* See how the game is structured internally
